## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 16.0)
- npm or yarn

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**

## Assumptions
- The payment system is mocked and does not include real transactions.
- The customer management system stores data temporarily (not persisted in a database).
- The cart system is based on frontend state and does not use a backend.

## Limitations
- No real-time updates (e.g., no WebSocket or API integration).
- No authentication or user login system implemented.
- No backend integration; all data is stored in memory/local storage.
